The proposed process effects the separation of CO<sub>2 </sub>from a mixture of gases (such as flue gas/fuel gas) by its reaction with metal oxides (such as calcium oxide). The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO<sub>2 </sub>(CaRS&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>) process consists of contacting a CO<sub>2 </sub>laden gas with calcium oxide (CaO) in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO<sub>2 </sub>by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCOa). Once &#x201c;spent&#x201d;, CaCO<sub>3 </sub>is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO<sub>2</sub>.

This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO<sub>3 </sub>structure, developed by a process detailed elsewhere, that attains &#x3e;90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles.
