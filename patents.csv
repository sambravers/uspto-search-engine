The present invention includes combusting a first fuel stream to a reforming furnace, producing reforming heat and a hot exhaust stream. Then exchanging heat indirectly between the hot exhaust stream and a first feed water stream, producing a first steam stream. Then providing a hydrocarbon containing stream and a feed steam stream to the reforming furnace, utilizing the reforming heat and producing a hot raw syngas stream. Then exchanging heat indirectly between the hot raw syngas stream and second feedwater stream, producing a second steam stream and a cooled, raw syngas stream. Then introducing the cooled, raw syngas stream to a CO shift converter, producing a shifted syngas stream. Then introducing the shifted syngas stream into a pressure swing adsorption unit, producing a hydrogen product stream and a tail gas stream. Then introducing the tail gas stream to a CO2 removal unit, producing a CO2 stream and a recycle stream; compressing the recycle stream, producing a compressed recycle stream. Then combining the compressed recycle stream with at least one stream selected from the group consisting of the hydrocarbon containing stream, the cooled raw syngas stream, the shifted syngas stream, and the tail gas stream. Then combining the first steam stream and the second steam stream, producing the feed steam stream.",2012-02-28,8124049,Zero steam export with CO2 recovery in a high thermal efficiency hydrogen plant
