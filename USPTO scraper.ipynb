    "This is the page where the current iteration of BC's internal patent scraper lives. Below is a Python wrapper for the USPTO's PatentsView API, which allows for anyone who'd like to interact with the full database to do so more easily and fluidly. There's much more to be done with this tool that would allow it to be more intuitive and more powerful. Listed below are some of the adjustments that would significantly improve the usability of the tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   <s>Creating some UI that allows for users to simply enter search terms into some box, as opposed to editing the list `` terms `` in the `` generate_search_terms `` function (additionally, the same for those search terms to be permuted (accessible under the `` generate_search_terms `` function, as well))</s> S.B. 30-06-18 <s>(Although now must fix permutation, as it no longer works proerly, because of how Tk.get() outputs)</s> S.B. 30-06-18\n",
    "2.   Adding a drop-down selectable list of types of searches (currently, the only included is `` _text_phrase ``, as seen in `` format_search_terms ``) - other possible search types are listed on [this webpage](http://www.patentsview.org/api/query-language.html)\n",
    "3.   <s>Adding two input boxes for start- and end-dates of the search (currently, this is adjusted through the `` start_date `` and `` end_date `` parameters underneath the `` stringify_list `` function)</s> S.B. 30-06-18\n",
    "4.   <s>Adding a better input method for the number of patents that should be returned (currently, this adjusted through the `` limit `` pararmeter underneath `` end_date ``)</s> S.B. 30-06-18\n",
    "5.   <s>Adding a better input method for what types of data should be returned from the search (currently, this is adjusted through the `` fields `` list underneath `` limit ``, and all of the other options for what type of data can be output are listed in the \"7 API Endpoints\" drop-down in the menu of [this webpage](http://www.patentsview.org/api/doc.html))</s> S.B. 30-06-18\n",
    "6.   <s>The wrapper currently outputs a JSON object, which yields something easily legible when put through a JSON reader (like [this one](https://jsoneditoronline.org)) - however, it'd be ideal to have this wrapper output a CSV (after flattening the JSON object); an unsuccessful attempt has been made at this in the current iteration of the wrapper, and is commented out at the bottom for anyone who'd like to play around with it and attempt to get it working properly</s> A.B. 04-18\n",
    "7.   Build in some method of combining multiple calls on the query API to allow for more than 90 search terms to be inputted, possibly of multiple types (the limit can be seen, written explicitly, in the `` generate_search_terms `` function)\n",
    "8.   <s>Build in some method of specifying an output filepath</s> S.B. 04-07-18\n",
    "9.   <s>Build in a generator for descriptive filenames.</s> S.B. 04-07-18\n",
    "10.   Build in some form of long-term, disk-encoded memoization (likely will require some deeper structuring to be efficient beyond just storing every result)\n",
    "11.   <s>Add in a drop-down selection for the output filetype.</s> S.B. 04-07-18\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For anyone who lands on this page, if you'd like, feel free to clone the repository and play around with it, making any of the above adjustments, if you're willing to own the changes. You can contact me over Slack/Facebook/Phone to get collaborator-ship on the repository. When updating this page, please preserve the above list, adding to it with any requests for features that you feel would offer a worthwhile improvement to the tool. If you implement any of the above, feel free to add those implementations to the code below, ensuring that everything continues to work properly. Please strikethrough in the above list the item implemented, without removing it, and tack on your initials, as well as the date on which the adjustment was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included a long list of fields in the multi-selectable list in the UI, but if you require any more in your use of the scraper, please reference [this](http://www.patentsview.org/api/patent.html) webpage, which can also be used for disambiguation of the currently implemented fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the wrapper itself was written mostly by Anish Balaji, with some help from Sam Braverman. Sam handled most of continued development and the UI implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Instructions for Use:</b>\n",
    "1.   Clone/download this repository to your local machine, and navigate to the working directory for it. Open the \"USPTO scraper.ipynb\" file with Anaconda Navigator or similar.\n",
    "2.   Run the cell below, either by the options in the bar at the top of the page or by pressing `` Shift + Enter/Return ``\n",
    "3.   Input your desired idividual search terms as comma-separated values, with no quotes in any field. The \"processes or objects\" and \"types of processes or objects\" fields must have input input in the format `` [\"term_1\", \"term_2\", ..., \"term_n\"] ``. Apologies for that, but it was a surprisingly large hassle to find another way to get permutation working. Dates should be in the format MM-DD-YY (sorry). Search terms in \"processes or objects\" and \"types of processes or objects\" will be permuted with each other. The \"Display limit\" field limits how many patents are returned by the search.\n",
    "4.   Whatever the selected output type is, the correct file extension will be appended on to whatever filepath is put in the \"Output filepath\" field, including the default filepath, so there is no need to include one in writing a filepath.\n",
    "5.   Click search.\n",
    "6.   The results will be printed in the output of the cell, and will be saved to the file \"patents.csv\" in the working directory of the repository."
