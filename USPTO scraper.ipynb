    "This is the page where the current iteration of BC's internal patent scraper lives. Below is a Python wrapper for the USPTO's PatentsView API, which allows for anyone who'd like to interact with the full database to do so more easily and fluidly. There's much more to be done with this tool that would allow it to be more intuitive and more powerful. Listed below are some of the adjustments that would significantly improve the usability of the tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   <s>Creating some UI that allows for users to simply enter search terms into some box, as opposed to editing the list `` terms `` in the `` generate_search_terms `` function (additionally, the same for those search terms to be permuted (accessible under the `` generate_search_terms `` function, as well))</s> S.B. 30-06-18 (Although now must fix permutation, as it no longer works proerly, because of how Tk.get() outputs)\n",
    "2.   Adding a drop-down selectable list of types of searches (currently, the only included is `` _text_phrase ``, as seen in `` format_search_terms ``) - other possible search types are listed on [this webpage](http://www.patentsview.org/api/query-language.html)\n",
    "3.   <s>Adding two input boxes for start- and end-dates of the search (currently, this is adjusted through the `` start_date `` and `` end_date `` parameters underneath the `` stringify_list `` function)</s> S.B. 30-06-18\n",
    "4.   <s>Adding a better input method for the number of patents that should be returned (currently, this adjusted through the `` limit `` pararmeter underneath `` end_date ``)</s> S.B. 30-06-18\n",
    "5.   Adding a better input method for what types of data should be returned from the search (currently, this is adjusted through the `` fields `` list underneath `` limit ``, and all of the other options for what type of data can be output are listed in the \"7 API Endpoints\" drop-down in the menu of [this webpage](http://www.patentsview.org/api/doc.html))\n",
    "6.   <s>The wrapper currently outputs a JSON object, which yields something easily legible when put through a JSON reader (like [this one](https://jsoneditoronline.org)) - however, it'd be ideal to have this wrapper output a CSV (after flattening the JSON object); an unsuccessful attempt has been made at this in the current iteration of the wrapper, and is commented out at the bottom for anyone who'd like to play around with it and attempt to get it working properly</s> A.B. 04-18\n",
    "7.   Build in some method of combining multiple calls on the query API to allow for more than 90 search terms to be inputted, possibly of multiple types (the limit can be seen, written explicitly, in the `` generate_search_terms `` function)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For anyone who lands on this page, if you'd like, feel free to copy out the code and play around with it, making any of the above adjustments, if you're willing to own the changes. When updating this page, please preserve the above list, adding to it with any requests for features that you feel would offer a worthwhile improvement to the tool. If you implement any of the above, feel free to add those implementations to the code below, ensuring that everything continues to work properly. Please strikethrough in the above list the item implemented, without removing it, and add on the date the adjustment was made, as well as your name, for the sake of tracking changes.\n",

The present invention includes combusting a first fuel stream to a reforming furnace, producing reforming heat and a hot exhaust stream. Then exchanging heat indirectly between the hot exhaust stream and a first feed water stream, producing a first steam stream. Then providing a hydrocarbon containing stream and a feed steam stream to the reforming furnace, utilizing the reforming heat and producing a hot raw syngas stream. Then exchanging heat indirectly between the hot raw syngas stream and second feedwater stream, producing a second steam stream and a cooled, raw syngas stream. Then introducing the cooled, raw syngas stream to a CO shift converter, producing a shifted syngas stream. Then introducing the shifted syngas stream into a pressure swing adsorption unit, producing a hydrogen product stream and a tail gas stream. Then introducing the tail gas stream to a CO2 removal unit, producing a CO2 stream and a recycle stream; compressing the recycle stream, producing a compressed recycle stream. Then combining the compressed recycle stream with at least one stream selected from the group consisting of the hydrocarbon containing stream, the cooled raw syngas stream, the shifted syngas stream, and the tail gas stream. Then combining the first steam stream and the second steam stream, producing the feed steam stream.\",\"patent_title\":\"Zero steam export with CO2 recovery in a high thermal efficiency hydrogen plant\",\"assignees\":[{\"assignee_organization\":\"Air Liquide Process & Construction, Inc.\",\"assignee_lastknown_country\":\"US\",\"assignee_key_id\":\"134560\"}],\"cpcs\":[{\"cpc_subsection_id\":\"C01\",\"cpc_subsection_title\":\"Inorganic chemistry\"},{\"cpc_subsection_id\":\"Y02\",\"cpc_subsection_title\":\"Technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against climate change\"}]}],\"count\":1,\"total_patent_count\":1}\n",
