    "This is the page where the current iteration of BC's internal patent scraper lives. Below is a Python wrapper for the USPTO's PatentsView API, which allows for anyone who'd like to interact with the full database to do so more easily and fluidly. There's much more to be done with this tool that would allow it to be more intuitive and more powerful. Listed below are some of the adjustments that would significantly improve the usability of the tool:\n",

    "2.   Adding a drop-down selectable list of types of searches (currently, the only included is `` _text_phrase ``, as seen in `` format_search_terms ``) - other possible search types are listed on [this webpage](http://www.patentsview.org/api/query-language.html)\n",

Adding a better input method for what types of data should be returned from the search (currently, this is adjusted through the `` fields `` list underneath `` limit ``, and all of the other options for what type of data can be output are listed in the \"7 API Endpoints\" drop-down in the menu of [this webpage](http://www.patentsview.org/api/doc.html))\n",

    "7.   Build in some method of combining multiple calls on the query API to allow for more than 90 search terms to be inputted, possibly of multiple types (the limit can be seen, written explicitly, in the `` generate_search_terms `` function)\n",

When updating this page, please preserve the above list, adding to it with any requests for features that you feel would offer a worthwhile improvement to the tool. If you implement any of the above, feel free to add those implementations to the code below, ensuring that everything continues to work properly.

The \"processes or objects\" and \"types of processes or objects\" fields must have input input in the format `` [\"term_1\", \"term_2\", ..., \"term_n\"] ``. Apologies for that, but it was a surprisingly large hassle to find another way to get permutationn working. Dates should be in the format MM-DD-YY (sorry). Search terms in \"processes or objects\" and \"types of processes or objects\" will be permuted with each other. The \"Display limit\" field limits how many patents are returned by the search.\n",
